I"­<p>Few months back Iâ€™ve discovered and started listening the excellent podcast <a href="https://slate.com/podcasts/the-secret-history-of-the-future">The Secret History of the Future</a>. Each episode of the series focusses on one technology that is currently making the news (AI, electricity and the brain, VR, autonomous drivingâ€¦ ) and compares it with historical moments when comparable innovations were causing very similar strong discussions. One of my favourite episode is about the problem of dealing with the ever-growing amount of information available online and through social media. If the overall amount of data is surely unprecedented, concerns about information overload are not new. When printing was invented, many intellectuals of the time, Martin Luther was one of them, were extremely worried that the new spread of publications would make it really hard to know what books were worth reading and which werenâ€™t.</p>
