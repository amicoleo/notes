<h2 id="2-loop-2019">2. Loop (2019)</h2>

<p><a href="https://loopstore.com/">Loop</a> is a new subscription service for zero-waste grocery used by huge companies (including P&amp;G, Unilever and others) that is due to start this 2019 in US and France. Packages are non disposable and when a replacement arrives, they pick up your old containers for reuse. This feels very big.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Loop will send you name-brand products, like Tide detergent, Crest mouthwash, or HÃ¤agen Dazs ice cream. When youâ€™re done, you ship the empty container back, where it gets cleaned and reused for the next customer.</p>
