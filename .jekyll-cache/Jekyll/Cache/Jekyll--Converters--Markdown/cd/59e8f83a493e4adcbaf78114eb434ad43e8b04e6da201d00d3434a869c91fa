I"È<p><em>Weâ€™ve decided to make more official the habit of writing weeknotes about the work I and Mike do at Uniform, creating a <a href="https://medium.com/uniform-creative-technology">Medium</a> publication and collaborating in writing duties. I still plan to keep writing my own notes in this blog, first because I find it useful and also because I like the idea of having my notes stored in a format (markdown) and in a place (my computer and a github repo) reasonably immune to the ups and downs of an company such as Medium. To avoid adding confusion, Iâ€™ll stop sharing link from this blog on social media, and if the current post is also present on the Medium publication, Iâ€™ll mark it below.</em></p>
