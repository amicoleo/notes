I"<p><a href="https://jods.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/design-as-participation">Design as participation</a> by Kevin Slavin is one of those rare readings whose ideas are so powerful that you know it will hang around in your head for quite some time. I cannot actually imagine to find myself thinking about the theory and practice of design in the future, without confronting with this short essay; and in fact, in some sort of backward domino effect, Iâ€™m already questioning and revising old ideas, through this new perspective.</p>
