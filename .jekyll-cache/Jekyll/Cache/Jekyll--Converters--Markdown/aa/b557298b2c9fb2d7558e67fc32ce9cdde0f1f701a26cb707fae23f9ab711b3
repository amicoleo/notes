I"~<p><em>I’m figuring out what this blog is and should be. From its original intention it was meant to be <a href="http://orgonomyproductions.info/notes/2016/09/11/welcome.html">“a place where to put scattered thoughts or notes about half-backed experiments not worth of making a whole project or a whole article”</a>. It has been like that sometimes, sometimes it hasn’t. What surely wasn’t, is consistent. The goal is to make it into a habit, so here I am again. At week 3 of this new course, my plan is to use it also for week-notes, in the sense of <a href="https://medium.com/job-garden/a-pre-history-of-weeknotes-plus-why-i-write-them-and-perhaps-why-you-should-too-week-16-31a4a5cbf7b0">Matt Webb</a> (Matt Webb’s Interconnected was actually the main source of inspiration when I started this, it all comes together… ). So, without further ado, let’s get started.</em></p>
