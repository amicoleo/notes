I"ü<p>Hi, test.</p>

<p>Many times I felt I could have used a place where to put scattered thoughts or notes about half-backed experiments not worth of making a whole project or a whole article (you can find longer and probably much less typo prone texts at <a href="https://medium.com/@orgonomyprod">medium</a>). Also I love markdown, and so here it is - a stripped down tiny Jekyll micro-blog.</p>

<p>I imagine sometimes posts will get a bit longer, but most of the times they will be over by about now.</p>
