<p>During a trip in Florence we passed by the great independent bookshop Todo Modo, and as I was paying for a illustrated children book by Iela Mari, and telling the owner about how I liked the work of her husband Enzo (Mari, one of the best and most known Italian designer), she recommended me the last book by yet another Mari, their son Michele: â€œLeggenda Privataâ€ (Private Legend). â€œItâ€™s his best novelâ€, she said, and then added: Enzo â€œÃ¨ una carognaâ€ - roughly translated, â€œis a bastardâ€.</p>

<p>So some time later I did get the book, and I loved it. Michele is an terrific writer, with a unique style and a powerful ability in creating images with words. But as the librarian warned, Enzoâ€™s figure is not a positive one. The man depicted in the book is an arrogant one, unable to see the world in any other way than his own; an husband that brought his wife Iela to the edge of depression and an extremely demanding, unloving father to his children.</p>

<p>So now every time I think of Mari designer, that with his Autoprogettazione reimagined his discipline in ways that could empower people beyond the rules of market and industry, I also think about Mari father, telling Michele not to cry when he was slapping him, â€œyour grandfather was using the belt with meâ€. And I think of the Mari Marxist-Leninist rational man that later disapproves of his sonâ€™s literary ambitions classing them as â€œfri-friâ€ (some mild derogatory expression for â€œgayâ€).</p>

<p>Iâ€™m not entirely sure on how this new perspective has changed my view on Enzo Mariâ€™s work. And this is not an unusual situation, many times we are asked to negotiate our opinions between the artist and the man behind it. And in the past Iâ€™ve dealt with it in different ways. I still indulge in Burzumâ€™s music from times to times, although I absolutely despise everything he did in his lifetime. While I stopped listening to Swans, whose music I love, after the <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/63799-swans-michael-gira-issues-statement-on-rape-accusations-larkin-grimm-responds/">allegations about Michael Gira</a> (maybe because Iâ€™ve seen Gira close enough in a live concert, and even on the stage he looked like an arrogant asshole).</p>

<p>Now, I cannot say that Iâ€™ve changed my opinion on the importance of Enzo Mariâ€™s work. But my always postponed plan of making my own Autoprogettazione table, well, maybe that will never happen anymore.</p>

<p>PS</p>

<p>Just after I finished writing this, I thought it made sense to translate it in Italian. Itâ€™s <a href="https://medium.com/@orgonomyprod/enzo-mari-designer-attraverso-michele-mari-scrittore-58f01a719df">here</a>.</p>
