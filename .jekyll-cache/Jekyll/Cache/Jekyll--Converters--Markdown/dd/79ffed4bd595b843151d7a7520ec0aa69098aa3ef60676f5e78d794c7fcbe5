I"<p>3 (approx) interesting projects, new or old, found (approx) this week.</p>

<h2 id="1-itty-bitty">1. Itty bitty</h2>

<p>A website in a url. No server, no hosting. The map is the territory. The medium is the message. The address is the house. Neat.</p>

<h2 id="2-painted-earth">2. Painted Earth</h2>

<p>Studio Moniker’s last project. Use your phone and geolocation to draw as you walk. Nice thing, as in all of their projects, it’s a website, not an app.</p>

<h2 id="3-living-with-bots-2015">3. Living with Bots (2015)</h2>

<p>Very nice interaction design concept. A smart home device made of a number of single-task bots, interacting with the people at home and with each other.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The group dynamics that arises from the bots placed in the main unit changes the relationship we have with might have with technology to something alike having a group of pets: never entirely predictable but always succeeding or failing with the best of intents.</p>
