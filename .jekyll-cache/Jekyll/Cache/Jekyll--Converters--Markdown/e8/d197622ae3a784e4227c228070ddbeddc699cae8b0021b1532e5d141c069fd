I"›<p>Itâ€™s April 2020, and for the lucky of us that can keep doing their job in the middle of a global shutdown and away from their office, the home is the new workplace. This is for me, since Monday, March 16th. Last social gathering was the Thursday before, a leaving party of a dear colleague at IXDS. From here, thinking of that event feels like a going back to another age, and it was only a month ago.</p>
