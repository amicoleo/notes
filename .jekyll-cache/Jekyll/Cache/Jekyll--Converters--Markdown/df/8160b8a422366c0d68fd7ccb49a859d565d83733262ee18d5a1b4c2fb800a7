<h1 id="notes">Notes</h1>

<p>As anticipated last week, we did a quick 3 days hack on face-to-face scenarios and communication technologies.</p>

<p>Our goal with the Shared Experience design theme is to develop an approach for designing digital products that especially considers the face-to-face surroundings of the user (the people around him in a specific moment and more in general the ones that he/she share spaces with through a house, a workplace, a neighbourhood etc.).</p>

<p>Smartphones have transformed our social moments. We believe there is an untapped opportunity to use our devices to enrich the time we spend with people; but in most cases the effect that smartphones have, is to isolate us from each other and to damage social interactions.</p>

<p>As a first step we decided to focus on the latter case, the negative scenario. The reason for that is that if we want to design products that are actually improving face-to-face situations, we needed to figure out also when we shouldn‚Äôt create a product. As designers working every day with technology, it‚Äôs easy to fall in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/mar/09/evgeny-morozov-technology-solutionism-interview"><em>solutionism</em></a>traps, that impulse to see in any issue a possible technological fix. And spending some time so identify the cases in which we need less, not more, tech, is an effective way to educate ourselves against those traps.</p>

<p>During the course of the hack, we identified three motivations people have for <em>phubbing</em>, the action of snubbing someone in favour of a mobile phone, and came up with three simple ideas to address them, each solution specifically un-technological, as a reminder that this wasn‚Äôt a space for a new product, but for reflecting on our use of existing ones.</p>

<p>We‚Äôre spending some more time to refine what we did and will soon share the result of the hack.</p>

<h1 id="findings">Findings</h1>

<h2 id="1-wearspace-2018">1. Wearspace (2018)</h2>

<p>A prototype by Panasonic. Basically it‚Äôs noise cancelling headphones attached to a fabric structure that covers the sides of you field of view. Ingenuous but effective solution for staying focused while at work, especially in open-space offices.</p>

<h2 id="2-anamorphic-playground-2018">2. Anamorphic Playground (2018)</h2>

<p>London based Unit Lab and studio friends, create products ‚Äúthat bring science into everyday objects‚Äù. Their latest project is a playground where pieces are distorted in real life, but appear normal when looked through warped mirrors placed in the playground.</p>

<h2 id="3-smarter-homes-2018">3. Smarter Homes (2018)</h2>

<p>If you have an interest on Design and the Internet of Things, chances are you‚Äôve heard of Alexandra Deschamps-Sonsino. She‚Äôve been giving talks,  organising conferences, writing and consulting about smart homes, connected objects and the likes since almost 10 years, always strongly working and advocating for ethical and human-centred values. She wrote a book on the topic that has just been released and I‚Äôm looking forward to start reading it. An introduction is available on her <a href="https://medium.com/@iotwatch/smarter-homes-how-technology-has-changed-your-home-life-an-introduction-5e8306a59a31">Medium</a>.</p>
