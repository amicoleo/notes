<p>I‚Äôve just finished a small project for friends at <a href="http://www.bloodysoundfucktory.com/it">Bloody Sound Fucktory</a> label. It‚Äôs 40 minutes, 10Hz, sound-reactive flashing visualisation to be watched with eyes closed while listening to psych-noise tour the force of Atto Terzo, by one-man drone psych noise act Lucifer Big Band.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs actually the third time I collaborate with them, always working on a design and packaging for a Lucifer Big Band release (this goes back to the time when I was making and releasing homemade noise CR-R with my tiny personal music <a href="label">http://orgonomy-records.tumblr.com/</a>). This time I wanted to do something more, that would be somehow more related with technology.</p>

<p>My initial proposal was to have the packaging turning into some kind of VR-like cardboard headset (like the one by <a href="http://happygoggles.se/en/">McDonald‚Äôs </a> or by <a href="http://www.coca-cola.co.uk/stories/virtual-reality-check-its-future-surrounds-us">Coca Cola</a>) to be used with a specific website. Just that the website was not featuring a VR experience, but a sound reactive version of Brion Gysin and Ian Sommerville‚Äôs Dream Machine device. There‚Äôs some nice and short story of the Dream Machine <a href="http://www.noah.org/science/dreamachine/">here</a>, but basically Ian Sommerville (an early computer programmer and William Burroughs‚Äôs ‚Äúsystems adviser‚Äù) built this light flickering device in order to replicate some kind of psychedelic experience Gysin had while staring eyes closed at the sun shining though an avenue of trees he was riding along in a bus. So the idea was to repurpose a device of (low-resolution) simulation like the cardboard VR headset into one of (high-resolution?!?) hallucination.</p>

<p>At the end we discarded the idea of the packaging insert - we found it really hard to try make it without looking too much like a gimmicky (see the above references), but everybody was still excited by the web app, so here it is: <a href="http://attoterzo.bloodysoundfucktory.com/">attoterzo.bloodysoundfucktory.com</a></p>

<p>I‚Äôve stumbled on some great technologies lately, I thought they were worth to mention here, for posterity.</p>
