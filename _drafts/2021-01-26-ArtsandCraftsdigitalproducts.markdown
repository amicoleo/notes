19th century artist William Morris’s idea of art is at the core of what I believe  is the greatest purpose of design work. In his own words: ”art made by the people, and for the people, as a happiness to the maker and the user."

In a period, the second half of 1800 in industrial England, characterized by cheap goods industrially produced by workers in miserable conditions and artists focussed in increasingly abstract paintings and uninterested in the real needs of society, Morris rejected both. He wanted artists to reconnect with the people, and the people to live their lives surrounded by good things. So he stopped painting and instead started to hand-make, and sell, chair, tables, prints, and other objects.

But the problem was that handmade objects took time and effort, and especially in an age when crafts had to compete with low quality, industrially manufactured goods, there was no chance that the "people" could afford things like the one that Morris made and sold. So what came to be called the Arts and Crafts, despite his initial social intentions, turned into a design trend of objects that only rich could buy (and still is today - link).

I read about William Morris’s idea of art, and its problematics, in Nikolaus Pevsner’s 1936 Pioneers of Modern Design. At the time, the “happiness to the user” part in Morris’ idea went on to influence the Bauhaus, where artists were designing goods to be industrially produced. But the other  important aspect of Morris thought, that artists would craft things themselves as “happiness to the maker”, was abandoned.

Fast forward to the late Industrial Age that we're living in now, and we can find in digital products the perfect medium for applying in full the social idea of art that Morris was talking about. Digital products can be infinitely reproducible handmade products, a team of one or two, can design and craft a product through code, keeping full control to the object production process and quality, not unlike as if hand-making a chair.






Why is this interesting?

There could be a reinassance in micro-software producers. And there could be a representation for it.

Indie Makers's community has some elements of it. But there's a lot of talks there in selling out the product, and in fact many indie products get sold, making it.

Why it doesn't come from a arts and humanities point of view, and only from a software or business persopectice.

Other example exist in the Indie Game world.

Notion is kinda like it. Pinboard is even more so, and so is my RSS reader Miniflux.

**Thoughts/Issues**
It would work best for personal software, it cannot compete with enterprise solutions.

It needs to have some kind of sharable aspect. Like people show their hats. People want to be proud to share.Can you show h

Pay once or subsctibtion model. Maintenance is problematic. On one hand, keep maintaning a product is not an activity that would make happy a digital products craftsman. But how long can a software keep working through an high speed cycle of os updates? Maybe there could be a guaranteed upkeep time (2 years), after which the product can be open sourced. Or maybe there could be a service of professional software upkeeper, that could do that for a monthly fee and then the product would be purchased as a subscription. I don't know.
