One of the benefit of using A.I. systems in designing digital products is that they are able to create unexpected "knowledge" that nor users or designer could have directly predicted.

Especially when we combine this with user data we can have a product that can create novel experiences and in particular surprise and wonder in users. Spotify Discovery Weekly is a prime example of this, which combining analytical data of songs and user generated playlists, creates for each of its users a weekly tailor-made playlist of never heard before (at least on Spotify) music ([here](https://qz.com/571007/the-magic-that-makes-spotifys-discover-weekly-playlists-so-damn-good/)). This might sound like nothing too different from a recommendation system, the suprise of its result makes it beyond that...

Focusing on creative professions, there are also some tools that leverage the capability human-like capability of new computer algorithms to boost our imagination. [Yossarian](https://yossarian.co/) by J. Paul Neeley at first sight looks like a mind map tool like there are many out there. But with a fundamental difference. The content of each node is generated automatically by the machine, with the user only directing this "algorithmic brainstorming" by setting the central node and tweaking a literal-lateral slider value.

Employment of machine learning technology in science is  is questioning the very nature of scientific enquiry.

“Since we first started carving notches in sticks, we have used things in the world to help us to know that world. But never before have we relied on things that did not mirror human patterns of reasoning — we knew what each notch represented — and that we could not later check to see how our non-sentient partners in knowing came up with those answers.”

1. Generative Adversarial Network

“The most significant arousal-raising properties for aesthetics are novelty, surprisingness, complexity, ambiguity, and puzzlingness,”

Because creativity is a re elaboration of experiences

2. There are databases for aesthetics judgment...

PS

Quite off a tangent from its practical applications, but I'm fascinating by the ways this new knowledge is created, through processes that humans can no longer comprehend and that are actually not even comparable to our own pattern of reasoning.

Wisdom from NN - the lack of context is a double edged sword. It means no context, but also means no bias. Or better say, just one kind of bias. A linguistic one.
