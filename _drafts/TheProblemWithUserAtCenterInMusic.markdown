Ok. Spotify saved the music business. It appeared when the new norm for was for users to access peer to peer platform, exchange music for free and get away with it. As p2p seemed to have fallen out of fashion, streaming platforms are undoubtably the new primary way that people listen to music.

But this is not a story of predating major corporation, possibly even involved in [warfare business](yanqui uxo cover), no, this is a successful story of user-centered design.

Spotify made 1B users thanks to the great experience of their product. People have become sensible to quality experiences. Good experience triumphed over an age of porn alert mayhem and automatic new tab hell.

But What have the music become with this shift? Musicians have disappeared from the equations.

If we exclude few notable exception, most musicians in the platform doesn't have any information on their page. The release years of albums are inconsistent and it's not unusual that artists get mixed up because they share the same name (that happened to me with Karate. At the end of one of their song, a trance-techno song from an omonimous band started playing)

When we talk to music in relationship of "context" we are not talking about the place and time where that particular song was written or the place and time where that particular band or was active. What we are referring to is OUR context. Spotify is filled with playlists such as Throwback Thursdays, Sunday Morning, Boozy Breakfast, Relax, Concentration and what not. Google Play's platform is even more specific, as its playlist can tune automatically with the weather and the location of the listener. But where are all the musicians gone?

<!-- Isn't all the songs that unexpectedly pop up in a AI curated playlist of Discover Weekly or Daily Mix the product of people, bands, scenes. -->

Recently Spotify was object of a contraversy. Somebody allegedly accused the company of having special agreements with some artists to make songs to feature in "ambient" playlists. Recently a case was brought on a case involving Spotify artists allegedly non-existent. https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/12/15961416/spotify-fake-artist-controversy-mystery-tracks

It's the toolification of music. The perfect soundtrack for every moment. Just that the bands, the scenes, the lyrics, the artists are not important anymore. All the stories that made up our music tastes are gone, all flattened into a glorified, involuntary muzak.

But are we protecting the artists enough?
How can this be sustainable to artists?

This is not a black-and-white matter. And I'll be keeping my subscription to Spotify. But I'm trying to be conscious about it.

A while ago I was commenting on a great essay by Kevin Slavin titled design as participation. Can his idea of participatory design be something we can borrow for

There are also alternatives...
