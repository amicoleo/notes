How do you create truly new products?

1. Just enough user research

Don Norman - User Research doesn't lead to innovation

"Do people need them? That question is answered over the next several decades as the technology moves from technical demonstration, to product, to failure, or perhaps to slow acceptance in the commercial world where slowly, after considerable time, the products and applications are jointly evolve, and slowly the need develops."

"The least interesting innovations to the university and company research community are the small, slow enhancements that gradually lower costs while improving performance. But in fact, not only is this where most product enhancement takes place, it is also where the research community can add the most value."

or

"do user research after" is this testing?

(the same approach is the one used by Amazon - pragmatism is what work)


2. Focus on the object

Ian Bogost - Innovation requires to radical focus on the product, not on the user

3. Nicholas Negroponte - incremental is not innovation

Homogeneous, disciplined Japanese society has all the ingredients to refine concepts better that anyone else, but none of the juices to invent new ones.

4. Be both the creator and the evaluator

The Google X way

(ancestors are X: Bell Laboratories and Xerox parc)
Hybrid creator and evaluator

It looks that at Google they have that Don Norman thing clear, as they were not at all ashamed to repurpose the society-shattering google glass invention into a manufacturing enhancements.

Right focus #MonkeyFirst - deep focus on hardest part of the problem
says Astro Teller


5. Steve Jobs

"It’s really hard to design products by focus groups. A lot of times, people don’t know what they want until you show it to them."

5. Steal from other fields


6. Develop a vision (?!?)
