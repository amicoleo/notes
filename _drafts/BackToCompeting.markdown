HomePod has been finally released. After 1 year (?) delay.

In "the epic struggle for the internet of things" Bruce Sterling suggested that tech companies (GAFA) are not directly interested in outdoing each other. At least not in a fierce direct competition in products, but rather in each promoting alternative vision, as if competitors didn't even exist.

Fast forward to 2017 and things seem to have changed. Voice Assistants products by Google, Amazon and the (soon to be released) Apple HomePod all try to sell us the same, similar looking product. Some kind of totem for our belonging to one of the stack.
