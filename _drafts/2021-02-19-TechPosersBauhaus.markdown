*Intro*

The Bauhaus greatest achievement was to make artists interested in creative use of technology to design things that are useful and nice to use. What I didn’t know was that their knowledge of the latest Technologies of their time was limited, and Gropius idea of a new unity of art and technology,  didn’t have the time or means to go beyond an idealistic aspiration.

If you are interested in creative use of technology to make things that are useful and nice to use, you owe that to the bauhaus. Thanks to them, we have things are designed by people with an artistic education and not  by engineers.

The Bauhaus did not alway represent that. The initial times at the Bauhaus were a continuation of arts and crafts…. But few among artists was willing to embrace industry like a possibility to create objects that could be affordable for the people. And since the move to Dessau, Gropius new motto for the school became an ambitious ‘art and technology: a new unity’.

But despite the aspirations to design objects to be industrially produced, few of the teacher at the time had experience in industrial production. So, as a result they were protoyping objects using basic shapes, mistakingly thinking that they would be easier to manufacture. And a sharp critique to their lack of technological knowledge came from Bucky Fuller some years after. Bucky fuller, familiar with their work due to connections at the Black Mountain College, the architecture of Bauhaus Walter Gropius architecture, didn’t incorporate any innovations in technical terms (like he did).

The end in is between. On one hand, probably artists at the Bauhaus would have been able to push their heritage even more. And I believe that they y

On the other, I wish for a stronger connection to the  that spirit of art got lost, with UX design becoming a career and not (reference to Simone interview).

So, maybe their lacked the engineering mindset.
But their best heritage to me is to get artists interested in applying their sensibility and technological innovation into doing things to help people get on with their lives. And, nerds or not, that remains.
