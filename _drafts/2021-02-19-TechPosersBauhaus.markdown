*Intro*

The Bauhaus greatest achievement was to make artists interested in the creative use of technology to design things that are useful and nice to use. And they did that without knowing a lot about tech.

Product, experience, interaction, industrial designers, creative technologists, UX engineers. If somehow you are a creative interested in making things that are useful and nice to use, you owe that to the Bauhaus. It’s also because of that school and their influence to art education that we can enjoy things designed by people with an artistic sensibility and not by engineers only.

The Bauhaus did not alway represent that. At its creation beginning, the school united academic and applied art a continuation of arts and crafts education. And at the time, few among artists was willing to collaborate with the industry to create mass-manufactured objects. Architect Walter Gropius, founder and director of the school, was especially passionate about social architecture. So he brought  his focus on designing things that common people could afford, also in the Bauhaus curriculum. And since 1925, when the Bauhaus moved to Dessau, the school new motto became ‘art and technology: a new unity’.

But despite the ambition of the Bauhaus to teach students how to design for the industry, few of the tutors at the time had experience in industrial production. The school method was still based on a combination of applied arts and academic education, and the students practical lessons was given by craftsman whose experience was in making handpieces and not in designing for production.

For instance, in the metal workshop under Moholy-Nagy, students would make products by hand but with a style they thought would be easy to reproduce industrially. So their objects were made of spheres, cylinders and other basic shapes. Except that due to their ignorance of industrial processes, those objects were actually hard to make in a mass-production facility

And the most iconic Bauhaus product output, Marcel Breuer’s tubular chairs, was inspired by bikes…

But the sharpest critique of their lack of technological knowledge came some years later from Bucky Fuller. Bucky Fuller was familiar to the work of the Bauhaus due to shared connections at the Black Mountain College in the US. According to Bucky Fuller the architecture of the Bauhaus merely created a style. They didn’t incorporate any innovation in constructions technique, didn’t rethink later solution in structures. For Bucky, Bauhauslers were excited about modernity without actually living up to their works. Basically, a bunch of posers. (Obviously Bucky did all the thinks he was criticising Gropius and the Bauhaus about.  But that’s a story I’ll save for some other time).

I understand the excitement. And probably artists at the Bauhaus would have been able to push their heritage even more, if they had some better connection with the industry of the time. But their best accomplishment to me is to get artists interested in applying their sensibility and technological innovation into doing things to help people get on with their lives. And, despite what Bucky thinks, nerds or not, that remains.
