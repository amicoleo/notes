## Intro

The photo above has been taken during a shoot, where we needed to have some animations on the photos. Conversations that day started to happen around it, especially on how that sight looked quite revelatory of what the future of what we see and hear will be.

## Where are we going (problem)

Augmented reality's promise is that it will radically change the way we experience the world.

The core of it is that reality will be mediated by technological tools. And this mediation will happen in real time, increasingly seamless.

Filmaker Keichi Matsuda released an uncanny vision of what our augmented reality future could be.


## Why are we going there (problem)

But without looking to far ahead, there are already many signals of how digital tools we use every day are distorting our world, often without us being aware of it.

Google maps shows certain shops to some people and not to others. Apparently, it also shows different versions of state borders.

Facebook is investing a lot in augmented reality. But unless there is an unlikely change in their business model, we can expect that the Zuckerberg flavoured augmented reality will suffer with the same issue of echo chamber that the blue app does.

And between this early signals and

If we look at digital tools are increasingly personalised to our preferences by AI algorithms that learn from our behaviours.

There's an attitude for communication companies.
We're actually going in that direction already.


## Going there is not great (problem)

The shared user experience insight. We're going to lose touch with each other.

We'll lose perspective on things. We'll struggle even more to understand each other.

##Â Insight

If as designers we don't stay focussed on creating products and experiences that
going forward we'll find ourselves in a world in which we have lost touch on each other.


So, if we are concerned about social bubbles and echo chambers now, how will it be when the same principles of "maximising engagement" will be applied in transforming in real-time the world we perceive?

If we design AR experiences with the same mindset we are designing social media, to maximise engagement, we'll find ourselves in a word in which we won't be able to emphatise each other, work together with a shared goal. A fragmented society with



## Conclusion (let's not go there)

We need to be aware of what's happening as users and as designers do what is in our power to avoid going there.
