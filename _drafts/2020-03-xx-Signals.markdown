# Findings

## 1. Terminal Slam video (2020)

{% include picture name="squarepusher.png" %}

Daito Manabe's video for a new Squarepusher song. It's a stroll in Tokyo's Shibuya and Harajuku as seen through the lens of machine-lerarning powered AR glasses, with object recognition labels, sound reactive billboards and masked-out people.

## 3. Google Maps traffic jam hack (2020)

{% include picture name="paperphone.png" %}
{% include picture name="envelope.png" %}

Two calm technolgy projects hacking your phone to make you use less of it.

Paper phone is an app that allows you to print on a piece of paper all the most important information for one day, like maps, contacts and calendar. So that for that day you can leave your phone at home.

Envelope is a set of cardboard boxes each transforming your phone into a single function device.

I love Special Projects.

## 2. Hey Robot (2019)

{% include picture name="heyRobot.png" %}

A game to play with friends and a voice assistant. Each person tries to make Google Home or Alexa to say a specific word by saying its definition. For instance: "what is that animal that has a long neck".
