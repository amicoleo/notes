<!-- Main Idea: products should enrich our life. Not only improve. Thankfully, some other people that were dealing with tech and design though the same.  -->


I believe that inventing new products should be about not only improving, but about enriching our lives. The promise of technology of making our life easier seems not enough for me. What about making it more fun? Or more weird? Or more exciting? After all, that's why I got into Interaction Design in the first place, as a resident in Fabrica in 2013.

In those days, Interaction Design meant to use software and electronics to create new kind of experiences for people. We were experimental, and came up with crazy and cool things: [music albums that would be affected by the surrounding spaces](https://angelosemeraro.info/sadly-by-your-side/), [gardens that would react by people passing by](https://www.jonathanchomko.com/), [lamps that would display the weather at the partner's location](https://orgonomyproductions.info/patchofsky/).

So now, as a designer and technology working in innovation consulting, I do feel the struggle to create solutions to our client's problem, while at the same time trying to bring ideas and features that add that element of joy. And it's not always easy.

<!-- Tech companies do try to make things funny. In fact, you can even ask Alexa or Google Home to tell you a joke. It's not going to be very nice, but, hey, they tried. But apart from these more straighforward cases I don't see many products that use new technology that are useful yet that you can be happy using it. -->

And I'm not alone in having this feeling. In a [recent conversation I had with Simone Rebaudengo](https://medium.com/@orgonomyprod/designing-not-so-intelligent-intelligent-things-an-interview-with-simone-rebaudengo-e02b07932992), he shared a similar same impression from the whole interaction design community.

 > Honestly, I’m a bit sad that I don’t see as many completely bonkers student projects anymore. I think interaction design has become a job, like a real job with a career. Now, even students show less lightness in exploring. [..] I really hope that in a couple of years there’ll be a new wave of students saying, “fuck all of this!”. I’m really waiting for some new students to come to me with something that I don’t understand and I’m like “what the hell are you doing?”.


Going back some years, there is a designer that I like to refer as an example of putting joy in products: Bruno Munari. Munari is especially famous for his weird projects, many of them specifically revolving about the use of things ([Searching for comfort in an uncomfortable chair](https://www.domusweb.it/en/from-the-archive/2012/03/31/searching-for-comfort-in-an-uncomfortable-chair.html), Useless ...).

But when it's about designing products,


And it's exactly for this reason that I like his thoughs on [Design as Art](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/276505/design-as-art-by-bruno-munari/). In there he Bruno Munari was in fact very against to design as style and very interested in the use of things.



So when I think of how to conciliate functionalism with joy, I think of him and his quote. And it somewhat suggests me that it can be done.


> Art shall not be separated from life: things that are good to look at, and bad to be used, should not exist.


Yes Bruno!

<!-- If



Despite some of Munari art work seems to specifically challenge the notion of use of common objects (useless machines, unreadable books), Bruno Munari was in fact very against to design as style and very interested in the use of things.

I'm not sure how


So I was happy when some past designers gave me some guidance, and reassurance. And it came from reading Munari [Design as Art](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/276505/design-as-art-by-bruno-munari/).

Despite some of Munari art work seems to specifically challenge the notion of use of common objects (useless machines, unreadable books), Bruno Munari was in fact very against to design as style and very interested in the use of things.

<!--

in his industrial design work and in his thinkining, Munari was extremely careful about the function. But at the same time, his designs are unconventional, weird and fun. Look at his Falkland lamp, for instance.

On the other hand






New unity of art and design.

Yet,

 I recently went back to read
Bruno Munari and Walter Gro  After I re



Those people from

Reading about those people, made me think that there could and should be a way out. Think of Munari for instance.

> Art shall not be separated from life: things that are good to look at, and bad to be used, should not exist.



Walter Gropius with the direction at the Bauhaus school and Bruno Munari with his design work, they both showed that products could be functional yet absolutely soulful.

Somewhat, I felt

Is there no space for

and visual and animations, rather that interaction and experience?



Thankfully somebody came to rescue from the past. Buno Munari. Despite some of Munari art work seems to specifically challenge the notion of use of common objects (useless machines, unreadable books), Bruno Munari was in fact very against to design as style and very interested in the use of things

> Art shall not be separated from life: things that are good to look at, and bad to be used, should not exist.

His thinking draws directly from the Bauhaus, idea of a new unity of art and technology.


And Munari's interpretation of this unity comes out





in his industrial design work and in his thinkining, Munari was extremely careful about the function. But at the same time, his designs are unconventional, weird and fun.


> Art shall not be separated from life: things that are good to look at, and bad to be used, should not exist.

runo Munari.. is
His conception of design is the one of Gropius and the Bauhaus...

And despite

his industrial design work never

Take his lamp
- lamp

or his clock
-




So that everytime I'm asking myself, if it's possible to combine functional objects that are a joy to use, and I think of Bruno. -->

Bruno Munari
1. Functionalism with Joy

2. Technolology inspired design


3. Munari method: da cosa nasce cosa

 classics came to my rescue: Walter Gropius and Bruno Munari. I see in this period, between the wars, when a group of modernist that decided to bring art to terms with industry the seed of the work we also do today. And among many, those two I like in particular. Walter Gropius with the direction at the Bauhaus school and Bruno Munari with his design work, they both showed that products could be functional yet absolutely soulful.
