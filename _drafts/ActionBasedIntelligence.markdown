Is there a connection between
- Rodney Brooks nouvelle intelligence https://people.csail.mit.edu/brooks/papers/elephants.pdf
- Don Norman ativity centered design https://www.jnd.org/dn.mss/human-centered_design_considered_harmful.html

And the fact that attempts to general intelligence inspired products (echo) are annoying and frustrating. While activity centered products (Roomba) is conforting and useful.

Also, how does that connect to the BASASP of BERG?
