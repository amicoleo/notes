We share houses. We share cars. We share workspaces.

But we live inside personal mediation of reality. Through phones. Through smart earplugs and soon through augmented reality display.

But what if the next technologies could be made to get us close to others rather than reaffirm our solitary view of the world?


From Adam Greenfield Dispatch.
"that the only lasting or deeply meaningful joys are those we share with others."


From David Byrne
"technology made by nerds make us all misantrophic beings"
