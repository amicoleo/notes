Well the all text here is crap...



Apologies in advance for the rudeness of the point I'll be making here, connecting two unrelated fields without any regard towards either of them. But I love that "clicking" feeling when far away notions somehow share a point, so I'll go on anyway. Part of my role at [Uniform](uniform.net) I often take part in ideas generation sessions. We have a number of techniques we often adopt, but sometimes I like to find and try new kind of exercises for getting out of our standard creative process.

Lately I found one called "[challenging existing assumptions](http://ozcontent.com/blog/ideation-techniques-and-processes/#ideation-10)", which consist in stating all perceived notions about a product/business, writing down the inverse of them and finally try make the inverted assumption real, by turning the inverted statement into something that might still work for the product.

So, thanks to a good Philosophy professor in high school, some authors we studied back then still pop up in my head sometimes. And few days ago I had a weird intuition about the technique I just mentioned and a philosopher you might have heard of, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. One of his most known concept of his philosophy is the one of dialectics. In a nutshell, philosopher Hegel describes history as a process progressing in thesis -> anthesis -> synthesis (not with this terms). There are destructive events that destroy what was there before and new periods are the result of a mediation between the negative events and what came before them.

So I thought. Isn't it the way that ideas are created as well? And finally that ideation exercise got a whole new light, as a stamp by Jena professor himself. Here's a portrait of him, with spirited eyes and huge sideburns.
