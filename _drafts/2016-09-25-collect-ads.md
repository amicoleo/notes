Alison and Peter Smithsons' “Today We Collect Ads” became famous as the first article that first used the term _Pop Art_. But the reason I like it so much is that it gives a great overview of how what impact among art and designers the advent of a form of image whose final purpose was ot sell products had on them.

> to understand the advertisements which appear in the New Yorker or Gentry one must have taken a course in Dublin literature, read a Time popularising article on cybernetics, and have majored in Higher Chinese Philosophy and Cosmetics. Such ads are packed with information - data of a way of life and a standard of living which they are simultaneously inventing and documenting. Ads which do not try to sell you the product except as a natural accessory of a way of life. They are good "images" and their technical virtuosity is almost magical. Many have involved as much effort for one page as goes into the building of a coffee bar. And this transient thing is making a bigger contribution to our visual climate than any of the traditionally fine arts.

and a proof of resilience of a certain economical model, able to repurpose even the most revolutionary, antagonist instance into a a new way to sell goods (the great rock and swindle). The role of advertisement in _inventing and documenting_ culture and lifestyles is certainly a valuable engine, that does a valuable service at spreading, amplyfing and refining underground culture, art and lifestyles - making them, if often devoided of their reason to exist, a form of art and culture nonetheless.




But if we look at advertisemnet today either invasive, disguised as transparent images, fostering and justifying massive collection of data online (in stotytelling ... ), and employed.






<!-- Some first small notes about advertisement, put together on a London -> Liverpool train back from #LDF, on a brand new web blog site.  -->


ads were important
and the impact


gives a important analysis of what avant-garde was seeing advertisement in the 60s. Similarly the case with Archigram and the very birth of pop art. For how desplicable the "commericialization" of radical phenomena (one for all the Sex Pistols operaction), codified and might lose primordial energy and goal, but for how distorted and disarmed of its most dangerous features and agendas, it would as least work as a gateway for getting to know about the culture that originated it. If not just be of value for itself.

Advertisement and advertisements seems to be an engine of innovation. Popular culture a rich source of content that would create culture by amplifying underground street phenomena into mainstream styles and way of living. Data driven advertisement is employed in the web relies instead in the targeting. For a society. Virality (the abilit to reach as many people as possible) is more effective for a extremely fragmented and dispersed audience. The craft, creativity is lost in exchange of abilities more akin to social hacking, in which people are lured or tricked into accessing and sharing a specific content.
