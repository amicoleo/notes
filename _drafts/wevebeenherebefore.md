NOTES
We’ve been here before - a reminder that our technological fear are maybe fresh, but surely not new
- the tv was the smartphone of the 70s - start with my brother's episode (ask cinzia to stop looking at smartphone and looking at TV instead and how I remember of "experts" recommending no more than 2h of TV per day, mostly on TV when I was a kid)
- the electricity was the internet of the 10s
- the type press was the communication overload of the 17th century
- the fear of technooogical unemployment was also with the power loom
- the fear and of nonhuman thinking machines is as old as the world


Without trying to dismiss current worries, it’s important to get a perspective to know that what is now normalised
