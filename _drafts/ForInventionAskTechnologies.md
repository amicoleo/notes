**Title (1): Invention is asking technology what it wants to be, not people what they want to have**

**Title (2): for invention, don't be human-centered. Be tech-centered**


"Good design is good business" said [IBM president Thomas Watson Jr.](https://qz.com/1431875/revisiting-ibms-good-design-is-good-business-slogan/) at a lecture at the University of Pennsylvania in 1973. It took some time for that notion to spread, but after almost 50 years, managers are now well aware of the impact that a user-centred focus have for their companies. And in all sectors, the role of user experience and service design has finally been recognised as fundamental in order to make products and services more intuitive and pleasant to use for people, and in turn more successful.

But as is often happens when a tool becomes popular, it starts to be used for things that go beyond its capabilities and initial purpose. And so we turn to human-centred design when we want to invent new things. And this doesn't work.

User-centered design excel at key stages of product development. Through research we can uncover needs and desires of people and set a direction for our solution, and by testing we can refine existing services and products from the feedback people give. But for that invention, for that leap from what was there before into something new, the best source of inspiration isn't people: it's technology.

If we look at the history, we discover that most inventions were developed not to meet a specific demand or need, but by people driven by curiosity or love for thinkering.

In Guns, Germs and Steel anthropologist Jared Diamond looks at how cultures in different parts of the world evolved. And one thing he notices is that across history the inventions that had the most impact in society were initially aimed for different purposes: as he puts it "invention is the mother of necessity, not vice-versa".

For instance, on an article explaining about his phonograph, Thomas Edison listed as potential uses for the technology recording the word of dying people, announcing clock time or teaching spelling. The less serious application of music was not part of his plans. But it was with its use in creating jukeboxes that the phonograph technology became popular and a commercial success.

Another example is the invention of the paper coffee filter. It too came from a technological exploration, when German housewife [Melitta Benz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melitta_Bentz) decided, after having tried many other solutions to brew coffee without leaving grounds in the cup, to experimenting with a technology she was familiar with - the blotting paper used for drying ink that her son used at school.

<!-- Invention requires hands-on familiarity with different tools and even a willingless to even forget people for a moment and focus on what the technology wants.  -->

<!-- This technology-led approach to invention can even -->

In a more philosophical angle, This technology-led approach to invention can be summarised as the result of a shift of focus, from what the user wants to what the technology wants.


Ian Bogost refers in this way in his article [Why a Toaster Is a Design Triumph](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/07/toaster-a-bit-more-button/534312/). The product's special feature is a unique "A Bit More" button that brings the bread down to get toasted just a bit longer. To Bogost this simple, small feature is not the outcome of a user research, but instead the result of the designer thing-centred, which led him "to make an object even more what it already is."


<!-- One more recent example is the  Little Printer by BERG. The celebrated internet connected product that could subscribe and print online content such as from Tumblr or Twitter, was mostly a result of a technology-led explorations. First the creative re-use of the ubiquitous yet overlooked technology of thermal paper and secondly the original notion of connected objects as new physical nodes for the internet ecosystem of interconnected services - in a time where RSS and Web APIs were at their popularity peak - rather that using the web as a only communication lane. -->


And a similar technology-first framing can also explain the work we at IXDS did with Rambus. Rambus manufactures a low-cost visual sensing technology, that embedded in a tiny sensor can detect and movement in front of it.

With the [Assembly/Mantainence use case](https://ixds.com/press/exploring-the-future-of-lensless-smart-sensors) we prototyped in collaboration with the manufacturing company, we asked ourselves what we could invent that could take advantage of the fact that the sensor is so cheap that could be destroyed? The result is a solution for aiding the assembly of big structures and machines such as wind turbines or airplanes. The sensor placed in attach area of the two parts to be assembled detect when they are aligned correctly, and after the two parts are joined together they simply get crashed in between them. The idea of this application came not by a researching the need on a specific sector, but by somehow asking the technology would it would enable us to do with it. **(ask Marten)**



<!-- This has been Apple Steve Jobs's approach to innovation, from his words that "people don't know what they want until you show it to them". But despite its reputation of a secretive genius-design department, Apple's innovation is a product of technological exploration. The most famous case is their introduction of the graphical user interface, which Jobs first saw in the R&D studios of Xeror PARC. -->

To invent, is about discovering new purposes for technologies, exploring what a technology can do and can enable us to do, especially beyond their initial, intended use.

And to be creative with with this technology-first approach, there are two requirements that we can take advantage of. The first is a broad knowledge on how different technologies are used in different sectors. As the examples of the phonograph and the coffee filter showed, often new ideas come by bringing solutions from an area of application to another. The second requirement is the curiosity and eagerness to prototype. Without an hands-on knowledge, we cannot expect to find what new applications a technology can be used for, especially when we are thinking with technologies outside their usual field; and neither we would be able to communicate clearly a novel interaction or product idea without a demonstrating it through a prototype.


An understanding of people is necessary for making solutions that we want to use. But the the goal is to create something new, beyond incremental improvements, is ok to forget about people for a moment and instead focus on what the technology have to say.

How do you create truly new products?

1. Just enough user research

Don Norman - User Research doesn't lead to innovation

"Do people need them? That question is answered over the next several decades as the technology moves from technical demonstration, to product, to failure, or perhaps to slow acceptance in the commercial world where slowly, after considerable time, the products and applications are jointly evolve, and slowly the need develops."

"The least interesting innovations to the university and company research community are the small, slow enhancements that gradually lower costs while improving performance. But in fact, not only is this where most product enhancement takes place, it is also where the research community can add the most value."
https://www.jnd.org/dn.mss/technology_first_needs_last.html

or

"do user research after" is this testing?
https://www.jnd.org/dn.mss/act_first_do_the_re.html


(the same approach is the one used by Amazon - pragmatism is what work)


2. Focus on the object

Ian Bogost - Innovation requires to radical focus on the product, not on the user



3. Nicholas Negroponte - incremental is not innovation

https://web.media.mit.edu/~nicholas/Wired/WIRED4-01.html

Homogeneous, disciplined Japanese society has all the ingredients to refine concepts better that anyone else, but none of the juices to invent new ones.

4. Be both the creator and the evaluator

(ancestors are X: Bell Laboratories and Xerox parc)
Hybrid creator and evaluator

It looks that at Google they have that Don Norman thing clear, as they were not at all ashamed to repurpose the society-shattering google glass invention into a manufacturing enhancements.

Right focus #MonkeyFirst - deep focus on hardest part of the problem
says Astro Teller


5. Steve Jobs

"It’s really hard to design products by focus groups. A lot of times, people don’t know what they want until you show it to them."

5. Steal from other fields


6. Develop a vision (?!?)
