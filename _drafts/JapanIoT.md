Homogeneous, disciplined Japanese society has all the ingredients to refine concepts better that anyone else, but none of the juices to invent new ones.

Japan is not particularly active on the smart home front. Line has developed a voice assistant, but Sony, Toshiba, Panasonic have released particularly exciting stuff.

i’ve  been to Japan recently and I’ve realized why.

It’s because the smart home, as we’re talking about it now, it’s not much more than automatation + data capture.

Japan has been on top of that since years, no wonder they didn’t see any interest  in the new frenzy about it.

Actually also about internet of shit. They had it already.

My wife [Tomomi](https://tomomimaezawa.com/) is Japanese and we've recently been to visit her family and to have some holidays there.

Fresh from work on the Smart Home we're doing in Uniform, I was particularly sensitive to all things automation, and without being particularly looking for it, there were plenty of things I started to realise about how Japan is doing it differently.

Japan is not particularly active on the smart home front. Most used social messanging app Line has developed a voice assistant, but all the traditional players Sony, Toshiba, Panasonic have released particularly exciting stuff, and they are generally absent from any IoT buzz. Partly that could be due to the fact that Japan has lost ground on the tech, surely.

But I was thinking that is was something else as well.

Travelling around Japan. In hotels, ryokan (guest house in traditional style) and visiting people, you see that automation is nothing new. Smart toilets, light controlled by remotes. My mother in law has just installed a new camera system for her door.

But here's the catch. All those devices that so commonly you find around are relying on pre-internet technology. There's no app and no server involved.

And here's my thought. Could that be that Japanese companies were just not too inspired to jump onto the IoT wagon just because what they saw there was just a replica of what they were selling since years already, but with an app on it?

On their side, they maybe missed an opportunity. But from the smart home user's POV there's little change on it.

Actually, and that's maybe reading too much into it, but they also had already their own Internet Of Shit. It's just enough to take a look f the electronic section of a Chindogu catalogue.

What do we think about when we think of 2018 smart home? A bunch of devices that we can control through an app.

Maybe the Smart Home has maybe overpromised. In which cases is the Internet really adding much to home automation?

Shortly after, [Stacey ](https://staceyoniot.com/rethinking-the-smart-home-in-2018/?mc_cid=4df594d7e5&mc_eid=ddd42dbb3d) had a text that had the same sound.

If the country seems to have lost ground in the mobile area

lost momentum in the mobile (iPhones are by far)

and being Japan, there were plenty of things to look out for, even with



Hey Smart Home. I’ve been to Japan, and those new things you promise are done there without the internet and without the smartphones, but with remote controls.

japanese people are not inventing iot because they already have domotics without need to controlling with a phone (light remote control, toilet, talking stove…)



Japan has


Just back from a trip to japan and in my ryokan they had a remote control for light.

Came back thinking. Of all the smarthome objects we have, did we really improve from it? The answer is no.

The smart home seems just a through smartphone and internet version of what I’ve seen there.

There are some exceptions (can ask about weather or the AI butler of ???) but

Hey smart home. I’ve been to Japan, and those new things you promise are done there without the internet and without the smartphones, but with remote controls.

the smarthome doesn’t exist.
