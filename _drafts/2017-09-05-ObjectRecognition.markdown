SSD: Single Shot Multibox Detector. A method for detecting objects in images using a single deep neural network ([link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325))

YOLO: You Only Look Once.

Mobilenets: a family of mobile-first computer vision models for TensorFlow, designed to effectively maximize accuracy while being mindful of the restricted resources for an on-device or embedded application. ([link](https://research.googleblog.com/2017/06/mobilenets-open-source-models-for.html))


Inception: A Convolutional Neural Network architecture for object recognition (without box detection). It went through a number of iterations, heres a overview of the,  http://nicolovaligi.com/history-inception-deep-learning-architecture.html

COCO: dataset


## August 2017

Google releases Android Example of its new Object Detection API - SSD w/Mobilenet detector trained on COCO ([link](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/examples/android))

## July 2017
Google Releases Tensorflow Object Detection API - ([link](https://research.googleblog.com/2017/06/supercharge-your-computer-vision-models.html))
