title:  What is Solarpunk?
description: The Bauhaus greatest achievement was to make artists interested in the creative use of technology, to design things that are useful and nice to use. And they did that without knowing a lot about tech.

I recently became interested in Solarpunk. As an informal, bottom-up movement, different groups interpret Solarpunk in different ways and there are plenty of texts online, each giving a different view of what Solarpunk is. Yet, I didnâ€™t find one definition that satisfied me completely.

So, borrowing from my favourite texts, here is my attempt to describe what Solarpunk is, focussing on the aspects of Solarpunk that I find most exciting. It's a long sentence, and there's barely punctuation. But it does it for me. Here it is.

# Solarpunk is a social and creative movement that proposes a vision of the world where we solved the environmental and social issues of our times through technological solutions that are in harmony with people and nature and a way of living that focuses on communities, conscious consumption and DIY.
