Hi, test.

Many times I felt I could have used a place where to put scattered thoughts or notes about half-backed experiments not worth of making a whole project or a whole article (you can find longer and probably much less typo prone texts at [medium](https://medium.com/@orgonomyprod)). Also I love markdown, and so here it is - a stripped down tiny Jekyll micro-blog.

I imagine sometimes posts will get a bit longer, but most of the times they will be over by about now.
