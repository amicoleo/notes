Do you feel that rigidly sticking to design processes and templates are preventing you to get the job done? There’s a name for it: Methodolatry.

Ulm School of Design professor Maldonado used the term in the 60s to critique the tendency among some faculty, at some point in the school, to ‘the distinctly irrational attitude' that would prefer to ‘forego a solution rather than arrive at a synthesis that could not be entirely determined algorithmically’ (read about that and in general a great overview of the Ulm School of Design [here](https://dasprogramm.co.uk/learn/writings/view/4)).

Fast forward to 2020 and between design thinking, design sprints… we’re overwhelmed by method-heavy processes to follow in a design project. How to manage between trusting the process and do what feels best to achieve the project result?
