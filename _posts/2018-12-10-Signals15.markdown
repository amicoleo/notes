Last week Mike and I have been in the starkly impressive city of Rotterdam for attending the Thingscon conference. Here's a bullet-point list with some comments about the day.


1. Ethics in Tech

The whole vibe of the conference was around ethics. It is a moment when the moral question in technology is asked over and over and


2. The Trust Mark

As a concrete action around ethics and tech, Peter Bihr is now collaborating with Mozilla and Dundee University


3. AI Personas workshop

Some words about the workshop we gave. Many of the participants were from University. Both students and teachers. It was interesting to see how our

## 1. Airbnb's Backyard  (2018)

Airbnb's has a project called Backyard in which they are planning to produce and sell houses.

> The spaces will be designed to be shared, from the ground up.

> The spaces will be designed to be shared, from the ground up. What exactly that looks like remains to be seen, but the suggestion is clear: They will be optimal Airbnb rentals to anyone who is interested in hosting, or perhaps even investing in the big business of backyard cottages.

> The spaces may also support co-living,

(On a side-note, the project is developed by Airbnb's internal research studio Samara, which was funded set-up after the acquisition by Airbnb of [Lapka](https://mylapka.com/), in my opinion the producer of the most beautiful product from this side of the millennium).

## 2. Doodle Master (2018)

##  3. Paperclip Maximizer (2018)

Hi! That's me sharing a small experiment with genetic algorithms I've been working on.

[Here](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/gads/what-is-the-genetic-algorithm.html)'s the simplest definition I could find of a genetic algorithm
>  The genetic algorithm is a method for solving both constrained and unconstrained optimization problems that is based on natural selection, the process that drives biological evolution. The genetic algorithm repeatedly modifies a population of individual solutions. At each step, the genetic algorithm selects individuals at random from the current population to be parents and uses them to produce the children for the next generation. Over successive generations, the population "evolves" toward an optimal solution.
