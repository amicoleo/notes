# Findings


## 1. Teenage Engineering Modular Pocket Operator (2019)

Teenage Engineering makes the most beautiful electronic products. Now they released a modular synthesizer that you assemble yourself and is just a charm.

> our small, battery operated and affordable synthesizer today expands into the modular analog universe.
with the introduction of three pre-configured chassis and 15 sound modules, there's finally a way for you
to explore the pure fun of modular synthesis in a hassle free way.
we have created three kits that include everything you need to get started. just bend, assemble and patch!

## 2. Loop (2019)

[Loop](https://loopstore.com/) is a new subscription service for zero-waste grocery used by huge companies (including P&G, Unilever and others) that is due to start this 2019 in US and France. Packages are non disposable and when a replacement arrives, they pick up your old containers for reuse. This feels very big.

> Loop will send you name-brand products, like Tide detergent, Crest mouthwash, or Häagen Dazs ice cream. When you’re done, you ship the empty container back, where it gets cleaned and reused for the next customer.

##  3. coolstuffcheap (2019)

Again on Chinese innovation, here's a Twitter account posting about cheap weird Chinese physical products to buy now. 

Chances are that if you thought about it, they sell it. And if you could never have thought about something like it, they sell it too.
