3 (approx) interesting projects, new or old, found (approx) this week.

## 1. Itty bitty

A website in a url. No server, no hosting. The map is the territory. The medium is the message. The address is the house. Neat.

## 2. Painted Earth

Studio Moniker's last project. Use your phone and geolocation to draw as you walk. Nice thing, as in all of their projects, it's a website, not an app.

## 3. Living with Bots (2015)

Very nice interaction design concept. A smart home device made of a number of single-task bots, interacting with the people at home and with each other.

> The group dynamics that arises from the bots placed in the main unit changes the relationship we have with might have with technology to something alike having a group of pets: never entirely predictable but always succeeding or failing with the best of intents.
